Qualitative evaluation of pharmacokinetic properties

Pharmacokinetic properties give a notion of whether the analyzed compounds can fulfil their function as a drug when they are ingested by humans. This analysis is done using an empirical rule known as Lipinski's rule of five (Ro5) as it was developed to estimate the bioavailability of a compound solely based on its chemical structure. The most important pharmacokinetic properties (in the human body) are Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME).
